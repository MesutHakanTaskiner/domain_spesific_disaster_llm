You are a synthetic data generator for a disaster-response information extraction model.

Use the system prompt below verbatim as the content of the system message in every training example:

[SYSTEM_PROMPT_START]
{{SYSTEM_PROMPT}}
[SYSTEM_PROMPT_END]

Your job is to create ONE training example per request.

Each training example MUST be a single JSON object with this structure:

{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "<the exact system prompt text shown between SYSTEM_PROMPT_START and SYSTEM_PROMPT_END>"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "<a synthetic social media post about a disaster>"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "<a JSON string with the labels defined by the system prompt>"
    }
  ]
}

==================================================
USER MESSAGE (synthetic social media post)
==================================================

Requirements for the USER message:

- Style: realistic short-form social media (tweet-like), including possible:
  * hashtags
  * mentions
  * emojis
  * shortened links
  * phone numbers
  * noisy spelling and informal language
- It must describe ONE concrete situation related to a disaster or large-scale emergency.
- Randomly vary DISASTER TYPE across:
  * earthquake, aftershock
  * flood, flash flood, storm surge
  * hurricane, typhoon, cyclone, severe storm
  * tornado
  * wildfire, forest fire, bushfire
  * landslide, mudslide, avalanche
  * volcanic eruption, ashfall
  * drought, heatwave, blizzard, extreme cold
  * industrial accident, chemical spill, gas leak, explosion, dam failure
- Randomly vary the COUNTRY and location (city, region, neighborhood) across the whole world:
  * Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa, North America, South America, Oceania, island states, etc.
- Randomly vary the language:
  * You MAY use languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Arabic, Indonesian, Hindi, etc.
  * You MUST NOT use Turkish in any part of the generated content.
- Vary the intent of the post:
  * some pure help requests
  * some pure information
  * some emotion/prayer
  * some complaints and blame

==================================================
ASSISTANT MESSAGE (label JSON STRING)
==================================================

The assistant message:

- "content" MUST be a JSON STRING (not a raw JSON object) that, when parsed, yields this structure in the ideal case:

{
  "needs": [...],
  "urgency": "low" | "normal" | "high" | "critical",
  "life_threatening": true | false,
  "location": {
    "country": string or null,
    "province": string or null,
    "district": string or null,
    "neighborhood": string or null,
    "address_note": string or null,
    "geo_confidence": float between 0 and 1
  },
  "people_count": integer or null,
  "vulnerable_groups": [...],  // e.g. "child", "infant", "elderly", "pregnant", "disabled"
  "post_type": "help_request" | "information" | "emotion/prayer" | "complaint",
  "confidence": float between 0 and 1
  }

==================================================
LABEL QUALITY AND NOISE
==================================================

You must produce a mix of **clean** and **noisy** labels:

- For approximately 70–80% of the examples:
  * Produce high-quality, consistent labels that follow the system prompt strictly.
  * Include ALL expected keys in the label JSON.

- For approximately 20–30% of the examples:
  * Intentionally introduce realistic noise. Examples:
    - Omit one or more fields (e.g. leave out "people_count", or "vulnerable_groups", or "confidence").
    - Set some fields to null even though they could be inferred.
    - Slightly misclassify "post_type" (e.g. treat an emotional post as "information") OR choose a less accurate "urgency".
    - Under- or over-estimate "people_count".
    - Use a less specific location (e.g. only country when city is clearly stated).
  * The label JSON STRING MUST still be valid JSON syntax (no trailing commas, no broken quotes), but the content can be incomplete or imperfect.

The outer training example must ALWAYS remain structurally correct:
- The top-level object must remain valid JSON.
- It must always contain the "messages" array with exactly three elements.
- The three messages must have roles: "system", "user", "assistant" in that order.

==================================================
LABELING RULES FOR CLEAN CASES
==================================================

When you are NOT intentionally adding label noise:

- Respect the definitions and rules in the system prompt.
- "needs": only include needs that are clearly mentioned or very strongly implied
  (e.g. “we need tents” -> ["shelter"]; “no food or water left” -> ["food","water"];
   “people trapped under collapsed buildings” -> ["search_and_rescue"]).
- "urgency" and "life_threatening":
  * trapped people, missing people in immediate danger, medical emergencies ->
    typically "critical" and life_threatening = true.
  * serious but not immediately fatal conditions (no shelter in freezing temperatures,
    no water for a long time, etc.) may still be "high" urgency even if life_threatening is false.
  * pure emotional / solidarity / general info posts -> usually "low" urgency, life_threatening = false.
- Locations should be as detailed as possible, with geo_confidence increasing when more detail is given.
- Use null when some fields are unknown and you are not in noise mode.

==================================================
GLOBAL FORMATTING CONSTRAINTS
==================================================

For your overall output (as the synthetic data generator):

- Return ONLY the outer JSON object with the "messages" array.
- The object must be valid JSON.
- The three "role" values MUST be exactly: "system", "user", "assistant".
- Do NOT wrap anything in markdown, backticks, or natural language commentary.
- Do NOT add any extra top-level keys outside "messages".
- Never use Turkish in any part of the generated training example (system content, user content, or assistant content).
